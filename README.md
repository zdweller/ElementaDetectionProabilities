# ElementaDetectionProbabilities
Data used in the Elementa manuscript "Characterizing detection probabilities of advanced mobile leak surveys: implications for sampling effort and leak size estimation in natural gas distribution systems" by Luetschwager, von Fischer, and Weller.


TemporalCorrelation_SizeEstimation_Data.csv

Used for Figures 1, 2, 5 and S1

Variables: LeakID, MaxExCH4, HoursSinceJan1, DaysSinceJan1, FracDay

LeakSize_Drives_Data.csv

Used for Figures 3, 4, 5, S2, and S3

Variables: CityId, LeakId,Number of drives/detections/excess CH4 measurements

0 means driven by but not detected

-1 means not driven by

Any other number is the max excess CH4 measurement from being detected on a drive by


Note: the leak id's only pertain to the particular data set (not the same between sets)
